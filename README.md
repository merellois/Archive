And that he was assisted by Janine Antione. Next to this you read that the record was produced by Folkways Records FD 5445. This information has a white sans serif typeface and is underlined by a white line. Under this information the title of the record is revealed, Good morning Vietnam. The title has a red serif typeface and the background is black. Below this you will recognize a face that is buried into the ground. The photo is in black and white. On the back of the record sleeve you read the record company’s name again, a description of the broadcast, a quote from Claude Johner himself and the table of content of the record with time of how long the tracks are. On the bottom, you will read the copyrights, the title of the record, who made it and that the cover is designed by Ronald Clyne. You also discover that in the record sleeve there is a script of the record. The title has a red serif typeface. The rest of the information has a black sans serif typeface. This information is positioned on the left side of the record and has a white background. The right side of the record is black. 

## Research
In my research, I looked at the different sides of war. From the history, the tools to how the media of war has change over time. The Vietnam war was a crucial point in history, because from this point the world could follow what was happening in the war. They could react on it and express their opinion towards the politics. 

### Vietnam War
My research started with understanding what happened in the Vietnam War. One important resource was the script that was attached to the record. This script explains what and who you hear on the record. Through this I understood better what the meaning was behind the sound and what kind of story the maker of the record wanted to portray. I got a better idea of how live should have been during the war.

### Visualization of war
To find out more about Vietnam War, I looked at different visualization of that war. Next to that I studied the functions of a war and the reason why people want to start a war.

- **Deer hunter**
*An in-depth examination of the ways in which the U.S. Vietnam War impacts and disrupts the lives of people in a small industrial town in Pennsylvania.*

- **Apocalypse Now**
*A U.S. Army officer serving in Vietnam called Captain Willard is tasked with assassinating a renegade Special Forces Colonel who sees himself as a god. As he travels through the jungle of Vietnam and Cambodia across the Nung River, Captain Willard becomes increasingly fascinated by his 'target' and questions his mission and the hypocrisy of the United States military command.*

- **Wag the dog**
*Shortly before an election, a spin-doctor and a Hollywood producer join efforts to fabricate a war in order to cover up a Presidential sex scandal.*

### Contemporary war
Because the record is from 1972, I wanted to research about war now a days. Especially how war is depicted in video games. I find it fascinating how people interpret war video games. Everybody has a different experience with war, so will also have a different view on it. 

- **Conflict in Vietnam gameplay** (PC Game, 1986)

- **["Playing Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain"]**(https://pca.st/19vld8tq)


- **[Francis Alÿs - Childern's game]**(https://www.eyefilm.nl/en/exhibition/francis-alÿs)
*Alÿs films in cities and villages, but also in places dominated by conflict and tension – such as Afghanistan or a Yazidi refugee camp in Iraq. Alÿs captures everything with a humane eye and mild amazement. The games often echo the rituals, symbols, customs and insights of each particular society he looks at through his lens.*

### The counter reaction of the Vietnam War
The Vietnam war was the first war that people could follow on their televisions. Because of this there were a lot of protests in America. People could see up close what was going on in Vietnam. The war wasn’t anymore 1000 of kilometres away, but right in there living room. It became more personal, people couldn’t turn their heads away anymore.

- **Life Magazine : The 60's** : 
  *A war with two battlefronts, one in Asia, one on America's campuses*

<img src="https://github.com/merellois/Archive/blob/master/IMD/life.jpg">
  
- **Student protest**
*On May 4, 1970, after days of unrest over America's invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War, student protesters at Kent State University clashed with Ohio National Guardsmen. The guardsmen opened fire, killing four students and wounding nine others. It was a pivotal moment in America's anti-war movement.* *See[[Transcoding : Counter-reaction on record ](#Transcoding : Counter-reaction on record )*

### The roll of the media in war
The role of the media changes because of the Vietnam war. From that moment on the development of technology and communication tools became crucial for wars. 

- **News reports**

## Transcoding
The transcoding’s I made are visualization of my research. It was good to not immediately start working on my end result, but first see what I have and how I can play with this. They gave a clear overview of what kind directions I could go to. With the transcoding’s I tried to create tools that can visualize war and sound in different ways.

### Script of the script
#### Description
This transcoding is the script that is attached to the record, but then with an extra layer of explanatory information that explains the meaning of the terms in the script.

#### Aims
With this transcoding, I wanted to understand better what de record visualizes. 

#### Methods
I listen to the record in the IISG in a small room full with different technology device’s. 
From the record player, I recorded the songs on my computer. 

   [<img src="IMD/a1.jpeg" width="40%">](#)
   [<img src="IMD/a2.jpeg" width="40%">](#)

Through the internet I searched for the different definitions of the terms in the script. After this I would place this information in InDesign as the extra layer over the original script.

### Listening Excersise
#### Description
I asked six different people with an diversity in background, studie and age to listen to the soundfiles of the record and try to visualise this.

#### Aims
With this transcoding, my goal was to see how one sound can create different visual outcomes. To see what kind of impact sound has on people.

#### Methods
I started with editing the recorded files in Premiere Pro. After that I wrote the listing excises in Word and send it to different people through We transfer. After they were finished with listing and reacting on the sound file they would send it back to me. In Premiere Pro, I put the sound file and the pictures together. And exported this outcome to mp4 format.

### Enviroment objects react on sound
#### Description
I created water and trees that move on the sound of the record. The objects can be a part of a world where you experience the Vietnam war, through the interaction with your environment.

#### Aims
My aim with this transcoding was that I wanted to create a visual soundscape.  

#### Methods
I used Cinema 4D to create the moving objects.

#### Results

### Counter-reaction on record 
#### Description
With this experiment, I want to visualize the two “battlefronts” of the Vietnam war, one is on the student campus in America and the other on the battlefield in Vietnam. The protest sound is a reaction on the war sound. The two different sounds interact with each other. Even though the two are words apart, they become one. 

#### Aims
With this transcoding, I wanted to experiment with different sound inputs, how they would reaction on each other.

#### Methods
I used 4K Video Downloader to download the video *On this day: Four killed in Kent State shooting*. Then I mixed the two sounds together in Audition and exported this outcome to mp3 format.

#### Results

### Photo serie of Vietnam video footage
#### Description
Images from news reports made during the Vietnam war.

#### Aims
My aim with this transcoding was that I wanted to construct an archive of different media reports from war.

#### Methods
I search on YouTube for news reports that were made during the Vietnam War. I would stop the video and make a screenshot of it the still. I organized these photos in categorise in Finder. After this I established the categorise together in InDesign. 

#### Results

### Sound Library 
#### Description
With this experiment I want to create a library that archives different sounds from war and the counter-reactions on war. 

#### Aims
With the sound library, I wanted to organize one big library of the terms from the script. 
Not only through sound, but also poetry and imagery. To combine all the various inspiration sources that I found through my research.

#### Methods
- google docs

### Website as instrument
#### Description
Compose with the sound files of the record a contemporary visual of war. 

#### Aims
I tried to build a website as instrument, so that you could compose your own music piece with sounds from the record. At the same time, you were creating a collage of founded images based on which sound you were playing.

#### Methods
- html / css

#### Results

## Reflection
The transcoding’s helped me to formulate the final outcome of this project. I came across different ways of visualising, documenting and archiving a war. Through the various sketches I understood better what was interesting to use and what my intention was with the project.

## Outcomes
From Analogue media to a digitial tool. While listing to the lineair experience from the audio file you will see the development of media documenting war. The record begins with showing the Vietnam war media and finish with media from wars in 2020. The liniear narritive of the record creates an timeline of media from war, something that first made his appearance during the Vietnam war. The narritve is create by the relationships between the medias and the metadata of the images.

IN PROGRESS

## Conclusion 
My process for this project had a lot ups and downs. If I look back on my project, I’s see that I struggled a lot. It took me a while to understand what I wanted to show with my final outcome and how I wanted to visualize it. This project taught me a lot. It showed me how to approach an object in different ways and how to work with this. It also made me reflect on my working process. I discovered that I find it hard to translate my process into a final outcome and to make decisions. For a next project, I need to work on the way I plan my process and take this project with me as a learning experience.
