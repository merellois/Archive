There is a story behind these recordings. It was during the Tet offensive of 1968. In one of the quarters of Cholon, the battle raged, the gunships machine-gunned  the market... dead... wounded...  houses in flames. And in this world of destruction, from the first floor of a  house that was untouched there came thesound of the scales of the piano, clear and laborious, as if the war did not exist at all. It was easy to imagine the child who was trying to do his best and whose scales rembled the last trace of life on a destroyed planet, Unfortunately, at that time the author was a photographer only and did not have a tape recorder with him. But he never forgot those scales coming from another world which at that moment conjured up that yet other world of war more powerfully than any visual image could have done.
